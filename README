This is the source code for EarthDemSim, a game for the Arduino.
The display is a MAX7219-based 8x8 red LED matrix display from
Deal Extreme (SKU #184854), and the game is controlled by an
old NES controller. There's no sound (yet). Pin connections
between Arduino, display and controller are shown in the source
code comments.

I wrote this game for Ludum Dare's MiniLD #42: 

http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2013/05/18/mini-ludum-dare-42-announcement/

The game is an Earth Demolition Simulator, wherein the player
shoots at the Earth from a spaceship. All implemented in 2k
of RAM on the arduino, and 64 pixels on the display.

On Github, there are two branches, "master" and "minild42". "minild42"
is the original code that I wrote for the MiniLD42 contest on Ludum
Dare. "master" is an updated branch that includes improvements that
I've added after the game deadline. I'm still adding new stuff to the
"master" branch.
